![FlowQuery](./FlowQueryLogoIcon.png)

A declarative query language for data processing pipelines.

FlowQuery is a declarative query language for defining and executing data processing pipelines involving (but not limited to) API calls over http. The language is very well suited for prototyping of for example LLM chain-of-thought pipelines involving fetching grounding data from APIs, and processing that grounding data in multiple successive LLM calls where the next call builds on previous results. FlowQuery is based on many of the core language constructs in the OpenCypher query language except (currently) concepts related to graphs. Additionally, FlowQuery implements its own language constructs, such as Python-style f-strings, and special predicate functions operating over lists. FlowQuery is not limited to its current capabilities and may evolve beyond this in the future to include language constructs such as variables and/or other language concepts from OpenCypher.

The main motivation of FlowQuery is rapid prototyping of fixed step data processing pipelines involving LLMs (for example chain-of-thought) and as such drastically shorten the work needed to create such data processing pipelines. A core business outcome of this is faster product value experimentation loops, which leads to shorter time-to-market for product ideas involving LLMs.

FlowQuery is written in TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and built/compiled runs both in browser or in Node as a self-contained one-file Javascript library.

- Test live at <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FlowQuery/" target="_blank">https://microsoft.github.io/FlowQuery/</a>.
- Try as a VSCode plugin from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FlowQuery.flowquery-vscode.

## Howto
- Dev: ```npm start```
  - This will start a FlowQuery command line where you can run statements.
- Test: ```npm test```
  - This will run all unit tests.
- Build: ```npm run build``` (builds for both Node and web)

## Installation & Usage

### Node.js

Install FlowQuery from npm:

```bash
npm install flowquery
```

Then use it in your code:

```javascript
const FlowQuery = require('flowquery').default;
// Or with ES modules:
// import FlowQuery from 'flowquery';

async function main() {
    const query = new FlowQuery('WITH 1 AS x RETURN x + 1');
    await query.run();
    console.log(query.results); // [ { expr0: 2 } ]
}

main();
```

### Browser

Include the minified bundle in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://microsoft.github.io/FlowQuery/flowquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
async function main() {
    const query = new FlowQuery('WITH 1 AS x RETURN x + 1');
    await query.run();
    console.log(query.results); // [ { expr0: 2 } ]
}

main();
</script>
```

Or import from the browser-specific entry point:

```javascript
import FlowQuery from 'flowquery/browser';

const query = new FlowQuery('WITH "Hello" AS greeting RETURN greeting');
await query.run();
console.log(query.results);
```

## Examples
See also ./misc/queries and ./tests/compute/runner.test.ts for more examples.
```cypher
/*
Collect 10 random pieces of wisdom and create a letter histogram.
*/
unwind range(0,10) as i
load json from "https://api.adviceslip.com/advice" as item
with join(collect(item.slip.advice),"") as wisdom
unwind split(wisdom,"") as letter
return letter, sum(1) as lettercount
```
```cypher
/*
  This query fetches 10 cat facts from the Cat Facts API (https://catfact.ninja/fact)
  and then uses the OpenAI API to analyze those cat facts and return a short summary
  of the most interesting facts and what they imply about cats as pets.
  
  To run this query, you need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY variable to your OpenAI API key.
  You also need to set the OpenAI-Organization header to your organization ID.
    You can find your organization ID in the OpenAI dashboard.
    See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat for more information.
*/

    'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' as OPENAI_API_KEY,

// Return the analysis
return catfacts_analysis

## Extending FlowQuery with Custom Functions

FlowQuery supports extending its functionality with custom functions using the `@FunctionDef` decorator. You can create scalar functions, aggregate functions, predicate functions, and async data providers.

### Installing the Extensibility API

Import the necessary classes and decorators from the extensibility module:

```typescript
import {
    Function,
    AggregateFunction,
    PredicateFunction,
    ReducerElement,
    FunctionDef
} from 'flowquery/extensibility';
```

### Creating a Custom Scalar Function

Scalar functions operate on individual values and return a result:

```typescript
import { Function, FunctionDef } from 'flowquery/extensibility';

@FunctionDef({
    description: "Doubles a number",
    category: "scalar",
    parameters: [{ name: "value", description: "Number to double", type: "number" }],
    output: { description: "Doubled value", type: "number" }
})
class Double extends Function {
    constructor() {
        super("double");
        this._expectedParameterCount = 1;
    }
    
    public value(): number {
        return this.getChildren()[0].value() * 2;
    }
}
```

Once defined, use it in your queries:

```cypher
WITH 5 AS num RETURN double(num) AS result
// Returns: [{ result: 10 }]
```

### Creating a Custom String Function

```typescript
import { Function, FunctionDef } from 'flowquery/extensibility';

@FunctionDef({
    description: "Reverses a string",
    category: "scalar",
    parameters: [{ name: "text", description: "String to reverse", type: "string" }],
    output: { description: "Reversed string", type: "string" }
})
class StrReverse extends Function {
    constructor() {
        super("strreverse");
        this._expectedParameterCount = 1;
    }
    
    public value(): string {
        const input = String(this.getChildren()[0].value());
        return input.split('').reverse().join('');
    }
}
```

Usage:

```cypher
WITH 'hello' AS s RETURN strreverse(s) AS reversed
// Returns: [{ reversed: 'olleh' }]
```

### Creating a Custom Aggregate Function

Aggregate functions process multiple values and return a single result. They require a `ReducerElement` to track state:

```typescript
import { AggregateFunction, ReducerElement, FunctionDef } from 'flowquery/extensibility';

class ProductElement extends ReducerElement {
    private _value: number = 1;
    public get value(): number {
        return this._value;
    }
    public set value(v: number) {
        this._value *= v;
    }
}

@FunctionDef({
    description: "Calculates the product of values",
    category: "aggregate",
    parameters: [{ name: "value", description: "Number to multiply", type: "number" }],
    output: { description: "Product of all values", type: "number" }
})
class Product extends AggregateFunction {
    constructor() {
        super("product");
        this._expectedParameterCount = 1;
    }
    
    public reduce(element: ReducerElement): void {
        element.value = this.firstChild().value();
    }
    
    public element(): ReducerElement {
        return new ProductElement();
    }
}
```

Usage:

```cypher
UNWIND [2, 3, 4] AS num RETURN product(num) AS result
// Returns: [{ result: 24 }]
```

### Creating a Custom Async Data Provider

Async providers allow you to create custom data sources that can be used with `LOAD JSON FROM`:

```typescript
import { FunctionDef, AsyncFunction } from 'flowquery/extensibility';

@FunctionDef({
    description: "Provides example data for testing",
    category: "async",
    parameters: [],
    output: { description: "Example data object", type: "object" }
})
class GetExampleData extends AsyncFunction {
    async *generate(): AsyncGenerator<any> {
        yield { id: 1, name: "Alice" };
        yield { id: 2, name: "Bob" };
    }
}
```

Usage:

```cypher
LOAD JSON FROM getExampleData() AS data RETURN data.id AS id, data.name AS name
// Returns: [{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }, { id: 2, name: "Bob" }]
```

### Using Custom Functions with Expressions

Custom functions integrate seamlessly with FlowQuery expressions and can be combined with other functions:

```cypher
// Using custom function with expressions
WITH 5 * 3 AS num RETURN addhundred(num) + 1 AS result

// Using multiple custom functions together
WITH 2 AS num RETURN triple(num) AS tripled, square(num) AS squared
```

### Introspecting Registered Functions

You can use the built-in `functions()` function to discover registered functions including your custom ones:

```cypher
WITH functions() AS funcs
UNWIND funcs AS f
WITH f WHERE f.name = 'double'
RETURN f.name AS name, f.description AS description, f.category AS category
```
